=> docker container run --publish 8082:80 nginx

Explanation:
1. First the nginx image will be downloaded from the docker hub. 
(if it is not already present in registry)
2. Started a new container from that image
3. opened port 8082 on the host IP
4. Routes that traffic to the container IP and the port 80

=> docker container run --publish 8082:80 --detach nginx
The "--detach" will run the container in the background

=> docker container ls 
Will list the running containers

=> docker container ls -a
will list all the containers

** docker container run -- will always run a new container from the image. 

=> docker container run --publish 8082:80 --detach --name my-nginx nginx
The "--name" option is used to provide a name to the container.

=> docker container top my-nginx
List the processes of the container.

=> docker container --help
Will list all the available commands that can be used with docker container.
